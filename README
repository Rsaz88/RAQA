# RAQA

large and high quality Arabic question answering
dataset. The Reading-comprehension Arabic Question
Answering (RAQA) dataset consisting of questions
collected from existing RC dataset and has a unified
format similar to the format of SQuAD where every
question has an answer that were extracted literally
from a related reading passage.
